# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a neural network from scratch using NumPy and fundamental mathematical concepts. The goal is to provide a deep understanding of the inner workings of neural networks without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks.

## Features

- Implementation of feedforward neural networks
- Backpropagation algorithm for training
- Various activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
- Customizable network architecture
- Basic optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-from-scratch.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install numpy

## Usage

from neural_network import NeuralNetwork

# Create a neural network with 2 input neurons, 3 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron

nn = NeuralNetwork([2, 3, 1])

# Train the network

nn.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.1)

# Make predictions

predictions = nn.predict(X_test)

## Project Structure
